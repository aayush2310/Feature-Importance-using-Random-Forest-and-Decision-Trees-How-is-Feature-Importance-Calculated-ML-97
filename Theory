We are doing tree based algos,the benefit of these is that we can use them to calculate feature importance as well.
Feature in ML means column,so we need to know the importance of a column.
In feature selection we select the important features and discard the non-important features which makes our model slow.
In feature importance we calculate a value(score) of each feature(column) of our dataset and find how much important is that feature for our algo.

eg:-Lets us take a pixel board where each pixel can be 0 or 1 and we use a handwriting classification problem,so the pixels in the centre and towards the center are more 
    important than those on the periphery,so feature importance and random forest is able to do so.
